About Community
<br>
Some have visited a canvas before. A place where togetherness created more. Now in numbers far smaller, taking less space, it falls upon you to create a better place.
<br><br>
Place has started. Thank you to everyone who participated. Maybe the real art was the friends we made along the way.
<br><br>
If there's no place like Place, you can give Place 5 stars.
